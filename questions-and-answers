2. Explore the push() method

  Using the Array class you just created above, add an item to the array. Use the following function:

  function main(){

    Array.SIZE_RATIO = 3;

    // Create an instance of the Array class
    let arr = new Array();

    // Add an item to the array
    arr.push(3);

    console.log(arr);
  }

What is the length, capacity and memory address of your array?

  length: 1 
  capacity: 3
  memory address: 3

Add the following in the main function and then print the array:

  arr.push(5);
  arr.push(15);
  arr.push(19);
  arr.push(45);
  arr.push(10);

What is the length, capacity and memory address of your array? Explain the result of your program after adding the new lines of code.

  length: 6
  capacity: 12
  memory address: 3
