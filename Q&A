2. Explore the push() method

  Using the Array class you just created above, add an item to the array. Use the following function:

  function main(){

    Array.SIZE_RATIO = 3;

    // Create an instance of the Array class
    let arr = new Array();

    // Add an item to the array
    arr.push(3);

    console.log(arr);
  }

  What is the length, capacity and memory address of your array?

    length: 1 
    capacity: 3
    memory address: 3

  Add the following in the main function and then print the array:

    arr.push(5);
    arr.push(15);
    arr.push(19);
    arr.push(45);
    arr.push(10);

  What is the length, capacity and memory address of your array? Explain the result of your program after adding the new lines of code.

    length: 6
    capacity: 12
    memory address: 3

    {1} When 3 is pushed into the array, the length changes to 1, the capacity is increased to 3 since the size ratio is 3.

    {2} When 5 is pushed into the array, the length changes to 2, the capacity remains at 3. The head stays at 3.

    {3} When 15 is pushed into the array, the length changes to 3. Length and capacity are 3.

    {4} When 19 is pushed into the array, the length changes to 4. Because length is greater than capacity the resize function is invoked. The capacity is increased to 12 due to the parameter inside the resize invocation, ((4 + 1) * 3). The ptr is where the new array starts at 3. The header is changed to 15.

    {5} When 45 is pushed into the array, the length increases to 5. The capacity remains the same since length is less than capacity. The ptr and header remain the same.

      {6} When 10 is pushed into the array, the length increases to 6. The capacity remains the same. The ptr and header remain the same.

3. Exploring the pop() method

  Add the following in the main function and then print the array:

    Length: 3
    Capacity: 12
    Ptr: 3
    
    19, 45, 10 remain in the array at the moment, but when new values are pushed into the array, they will be replaced.

4. Understanding more about how arrays work

  Print the 1st item in the array arr.

    In array.js: 

    print() {
      console.log(memory.memory[0]);
    }

  Empty the array and add just 1 item: arr.push("tauhida");

  Print this 1 item that you just added. What is the result? Can you explain your result?

    NaN is returned. Float64Array accepts either integers or floating-point numbers.

  What is the purpose of the _resize() function in your Array class?

    It increases the capacity.

5. URLify a string

  const urlify = (url) => {
    const newUrl = url.replace(/ /g, "%20")
    return newUrl
  }

  const url = "www.thinkful.com /tauh ida parv een";
  console.log(urlify(url))

  Time complexity: O(1)

6. Filtering an array

  Imagine you have an array of numbers. Write an algorithm to remove all numbers less than 5 from the array. DO NOT use Array's built-in .filter() method here; write the algorithm from scratch.

  const filter = (arr) => {

    const newArr = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[i] > 5) {
        newArr.push(arr[i])
      }
    }
    return newArr;
  }

  const arr = [4, 6, -3, 5, -2, 1, 7, 10];
  console.log(filter(arr));

7. max sum in the array

  You are given an array containing positive and negative integers. Write an algorithm which will find the largest sum in a continuous sequence.

  Input: [4, 6, -3, 5, -2, 1]
  Output: 12

    // Kadane's algorithm
    // O(n)

    const max = (arr) => {

      let maxSum = 0;
      let maxEnd = 0;

      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        maxEnd = maxEnd + arr[i]
        console.log("maxSum:", maxSum)

        if (maxEnd < 0) {
          maxEnd = 0
        }
        if (maxSum < maxEnd) {
          console.log("maxEnd:", maxEnd)
          maxSum = maxEnd
        }
      }

      return maxSum;
    }

    const arr = [4, 6, -3, 5, -2, 1];
    console.log(max(arr));

8. Merge arrays

  Imagine you have 2 arrays which have already been sorted. Write an algorithm to merge the 2 arrays into a single array, which should also be sorted.

  Input:[1, 3, 6, 8, 11] and [2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10]
  Output:[1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11]

    const merge = () => {

      const merged = one.concat(two);
      merged.sort((a, b) => {return a - b});
      return merged;
    }

    const one = [1, 3, 6, 8, 11];
    const two = [2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10];

    console.log(merge(one, two))

9. Remove characters

  Write an algorithm that deletes given characters from a string. For example, given a string of "Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Grozny" and the characters to be removed are "aeiou", the algorithm should transform the original string to "Bttl f th Vwls: Hw vs. Grzny". Do not use Javascript's filter, split, or join methods.

  Input:'Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Grozny', 'aeiou'
  Output: 'Bttl f th Vwls: Hw vs. Grzny'

    const remove = (str) => {

      return str.replace(/[aeiou]/g, "")
    }

    const str = "Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Grozny"
    console.log(remove(str))

10. Products

  Given an array of numbers, write an algorithm to find out the products of every other number except the number at each index.

  Input:[1, 3, 9, 4]
  Output:[108, 36, 12, 27]

    const prod = (arr) => {

      if (arr.length < 2) {
        throw new Error("This algorithm requires 3 or more elements.")
      }

      const productsOfAllIntsExpectIndex = [];

      let productSoFar = 1;
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        productsOfAllIntsExpectIndex[i] = productSoFar;
        productSoFar *= arr[i];
      }

      productSoFar = 1;
      for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        productsOfAllIntsExpectIndex[i] *= productSoFar;
        productSoFar *= arr[i];
      }

      return (productsOfAllIntsExpectIndex)
    }

    const arr = [1]
    console.log(prod(arr))

11. 2D array

  Write an algorithm which searches through a 2D array, and whenever it finds a 0 should set the entire row and column to 0.

  Input: [
    [1,0,1,1,0],
    [0,1,1,1,0],
    [1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,0,1,1,1],
    [1,1,1,1,1]
  ];

  Output: [
    [0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,1,1,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,1,1,0]
  ];

    var setZeroes = (matrix) => {

      const n = matrix.length,    // row
        m = matrix[0].length;     // column
      if (n < 1 || m < 1) {
        return;
      }

      // Flagging:
      // Flagging the first cell in the row and column as 0 when a cell with 0 is discovered.
      let firstCol = false;
      // Traverse to each new row...
      for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // If the first cell in the row is 0, mark it as true.
        if (matrix[i][0] == 0) {
          firstCol = true;
        }
        // Traverse to each column in each row...
        for (let j = 1; j < m; j++) {
          // If the cell is zero...
          if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
            // Mark the first cell in the row as 0.
            matrix[i][0] = 0;
            // Mark the first cell in the column as 0.
            matrix[0][j] = 0;
          }
        }
      }

      // Changing the cells:
      // Starting at (1, 1) and traversing to each cell...
      for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < m; j++){
          // If the cell in row 0 or column 0 is 0, change the value in the traversed cell to 0.
          if (matrix[i][0] == 0 || matrix[0][j] == 0) {
            matrix[i][j] = 0;
          }
        }
      }

      // If (0, 0) is 0...
      if (matrix[0][0] == 0) {
        // Traverse to the first cell in each column...
        for (let j = 0; j < m; j++){
          // Mark the first cell in each column as 0.
          matrix[0][j] = 0;
        }
      }

      // If first column is true aka there is a 0...
      if (firstCol) {
        // Traverse to each row...
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++){
          // Mark the first cell in each row as 0.
          matrix[i][0] = 0;
        }
      }
    };

    const matrix = [
      [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
      [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
      [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
      [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
      [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    ];
    console.log(setZeroes(matrix));

12. String rotation

  Given 2 strings, str1 and str2, write a program that checks if str2 is a rotation of str1.

  Input: amazon, azonma

  Output: False

  Input: amazon, azonam

  Output: true

    const checkRotation = (strOne, strTwo) => {
      let strArr = strOne.split("");

      if (strOne === "" && strTwo == "") {
        return true;
      }

      for (let i = 0; i < strArr.length; i++) {
        strArr.unshift(strArr.pop());
        if (strArr.join("") === strTwo) {
          return true;
        }
      }
      return false;
    };

    const strOne = "amazon";
    const strTwo = "azonma";
    console.log(checkRotation(strOne, strTwo));
